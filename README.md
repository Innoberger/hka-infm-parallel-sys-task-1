# hka-infm-parallel-sys-waschpark
Exercise 1 "Waschpark" in course "Parallel Systems" at Hochschule Karlsruhe

This is a training to get used to (Java) parallel programming.

## Compile

If your system got an executable version of [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (common on Linux and macOS), simply run `gradle build`.

Alternatively, you can run `./gradlew build` on Linux and macOS, or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows.

This will create a runnable jar file in `build/libs/`.



## Usage

Execute with `java -jar <jarfile>`, whereas `<jarfile>` corresponds to the built jar file path.
For example, use `java -jar build/libs/hka-infm-parallel-sys-waschpark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
